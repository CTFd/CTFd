## Managed Hosting

Looking to use CTFd but don't want to deal with managing infrastructure? Check out [the CTFd website](https://ctfd.io/) for managed CTFd deployments.

## MajorLeagueCyber

CTFd is heavily integrated with [MajorLeagueCyber](https://majorleaguecyber.org/). MajorLeagueCyber (MLC) is a CTF stats tracker that provides event scheduling, team tracking, and single sign on for events.

By registering your CTF event with MajorLeagueCyber users can automatically login, track their individual and team scores, submit writeups, and get notifications of important events.

To integrate with MajorLeagueCyber, simply register an account, create an event, and install the client ID and client secret in the relevant portion in `CTFd/config.py` or in the admin panel:

```python
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID = None
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = None
```
