# CTFd Configuration File
#
# Use this file to configure aspects of how CTFd behaves. Additional attributes can be specified for
# plugins and other additional behavior.
#
# If a configuration item is specified but left empty, CTFd will do the following:
#
#   1. Look for an environment variable under the same name and use that value if found
#   2. Use a default value specified in it's own internal configuration
#   3. Use a null value (i.e. None) or empty string for the configuration value

# SECRET_KEY:
# The secret value used to creation sessions and sign strings. This should be set to a random string. In the
# interest of ease, CTFd will automatically create a secret key file for you. If you wish to add this secret key
# to your instance you should hard code this value to a random static value.
#
# You can also remove .ctfd_secret_key from the .gitignore file and commit this file into whatever repository
# you are using.
