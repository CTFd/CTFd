     Taken from http://stackoverflow.com/a/22936947/4285524 but the generator there makes no sense.
     The trusted_proxies regexes is taken from Ruby on Rails.

     This has issues if the clients are also on the local network so you can remove proxies from config.py.

     CTFd does not use IP address for anything besides cursory tracking of teams and it is ill-advised to do much
     more than that if you do not know what you're doing.
